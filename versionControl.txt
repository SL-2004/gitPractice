2. a)
By having easy access to the entire history of a file, I can see where the problem occured in a program. By knowing this, I can easily identify the error, fix it, and learn not to make the same mistake again.

2. b)
I would want to have a version of my code saved when a large enough change was made so I have older versions that are different saved.
 You would not want regular intervals because then it would be hard to look through all of the versions that have no or minimal changes. 
You would not want after a long pause because a long pause doesn't necesarily indicate changes. 
You would not want just when you choose to save a version because if you forget to save, then you are stuck.
